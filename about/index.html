<p>Namaste, This is Vinoth, I am a software engineer with a loving family.Life was going normal for me but I was always in a search for my destiny. There came a time in my life for a need of alternative medicine. As a head of household it was really difficult and I really wanted to do something to help. That’s when my research got deeper and I started exploring options for alternative treatments. First I studied an online Acupressure Mastery course and saw its power by working on me, my family and friends. Nature has healing powers that we can tap into by using the right points. My research continued on to Ayurveda over the years following Dr. Vasant Lad. Step by step I started adding Ayurvedic daily routines and kept moving towards learning practicing natural remedies.</p>
<p>During a consultation with <strong>Dr. Vasant Lad</strong> he told me that I am a Natural healer based on my astrological chart. Initially I did not believe it but couldn’t deny it later. As time went on I have expanded my knowledge on Mantras, Mudhras (Hand Posture), Breathing exercise, Yoga Postures, Meditation and Chakra Healing as part of my routine. I see positive results in my family and friends.</p>
<p>Every one has to go through ups and downs in the life. There was a time I was down, through the Healing Angels and Guru blessing I got lot better through the magic of Pranic Healing (distance healing from India). As a software engineer it took over 10 years for my engineering mind to accept it and learn it. Only when we experience we will know the power of healing in any form (running, dancing, Yoga, etc…)</p>
<p>Along with Ayurvedic knowledge of that each person is unique, I am blessed to understand each individual and help them heal with the combination of Reading Body Signs, Marma, Mantra, Pranic and daily routines.</p>
<p>Now I understood my destiny, Actual happiness is when you are able to empower people to grow and make them happier and healthier naturally.</p>
<p>Nature always works wonders, supporting humankind. When our thoughts align with Nature, the Universe provides all the support we need.</p>
<p>In the last couple of years, many miracles happened with the clients. Possible only the giver and receiver are open and tunes in to same frequency. Like how we listen to Radio or how we download the data in our cellular phone or data transfer via WIFI to TV.</p>
<p>Exploring how to help with data points, that’s when the Quantum Healing helps to understand the Information Field, Frequency and entanglement along with HRV data.</p>
<p>Whatever I have been doing is <strong>Quantum Healing</strong>.</p>
<p>Learning continues…</p>
